CHANGELOG Meresco-Components
============================

version: 3.4.2 -> 3.4.3
date:    2010-10-12

Old behaviour on missing fromKwarg
----------------------------------
The converters now display their old behaviour if the specified fromKwarg is 
not present in the kwargs.
(2010-10-12, 3.4.2-NED)

==============================================================================

version: 3.4.1 -> 3.4.2
date:    2010-09-28

! The interface of SRUTermDrilldown.extraResponseData has changed in a 
  not-backwards-compatible way (as described below). Even so, this will
  not break the majority of existing applications (in which SRUTermDrilldown
  is just simply observing SruHandler, which was updated correspondingly).

extraResponseData now takes docset parameter
--------------------------------------------
extraResponseData now takes docset parameter (instead of cqlAbstractSyntaxTree
parameter) to prevent distinct components having to call docsetFromQuery more
than once.
(2010-09-27, 3.4.1-NED)

==============================================================================

version: 3.4 -> 3.4.1
date:    2010-09-27

GC no longer disabled inside DocSet::forTerm
--------------------------------------------
Fixed memory leak on server startup by no longer disabling GC (which seemed a
valid performance improvement).
(2010-09-27, 3.4-NED)

==============================================================================

version: 3.3 -> 3.4
date:    2010-09-20

!! Meresco-components 3.4 is not backwards compatible with Meresco 
   Compontents 3.3. The "Consistent naming of add parameters" change breaks
   compatibility(see below).

Use Meresco Xml package instead of CQ2Utils/XmlUtils
----------------------------------------------------
The xmlutils are extracted from the CQ2Utils project into a separate Meresco
project called Meresco-Xml. This changeset alters the imports needed for the
use of Meresco-Xml. It also removes some unnecessary imports.

_luceneDelete deletes all Lucene documents with given identifier 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Recognizing that - as the consequence of an historical bug - there may be
more Lucene records with the same identifier, _luceneDelete will now delete
all of them (instead of giving up on deleting anything alltogether).

Consistent naming of add parameters 
-----------------------------------
To stimulate the use of kwargs in add calls, matching add methods on several
components now take consistently named keyword arguments. 
Also: adapted xmlpump converters to take a fromKwarg and toKwarg parameter to 
make conversion more explicit.

DocSet.fromQuery catches and reraises Lucene's TooManyClauses exception
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
It was possible to cause a process to abort by calling DocSet.fromQuery with
a PrefixQuery that caused a TooManyClauses exception. This situation will now
result in an appropriate Python RuntimeError.
